Having access to system models is essential in control theory. To understand the underlying analytical equations of a system, a white-box-model is needed. \textit{Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics} (SINDy) is a method to identify the governing equations of a system from its measurement data. SINDy is tested on systems of different complexity to establish guidelines for an effective use. Furthermore, techniques are shown to enhance the accuracy of the algorithm and make use of prior knowledge of the system.
